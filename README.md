These codes combine the signatures (from rough path theory) with the genetic algorithm (SigGa) to achieve dimension reduction.
The results from SigGa are then used in a polymodel approach (nonlinear relationships among these factors) to compute the return/risk of each stock, and rank.
We use fundamental data unique to each stock. Macroeconomic indicators common to all stocks, and ETFs market risk variables like Gold, Silver, Oil, momentum, etc
