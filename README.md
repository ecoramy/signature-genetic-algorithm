These codes combine the signatures (from rough path theory) with the genetic algorithm (SigGa) to achieve dimension reduction.
The results from SigGa are then used in a polymodel approach (nonlinear relationships among these factors) to compute the return/risk of each stock, and rank.
We select 5 indicators for each stock out of 244 indicators. The data consists of fundamental data unique to each stock with approximately 78 variables. Macroeconomic indicators are common to all stocks with approximately 88 variables, and ETFs market risk variables like Gold, Silver, Oil, and momentum with approximately 78 variables. 
The run_all.py file shows in which order the Python scripts should be executed.
